            Hello! My name is Philip Kim. I'm currently working part-time at an
            independent pharmacy as a clerk. I'm also doing minor translating
            work (from Korean to English) on the side. I have recently completed
            a Coding Bootcamp provided by UCI and am preparing to further
            develop myself in the software engineering field.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            I am very curious about many different subjects, and enjoy learning
            new things. As such, I'm eager to take on new challenges and see
            what I can learn from them.
