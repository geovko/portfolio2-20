          Hello! My name is Philip Kim. I'm currently working part-time at an
          independent pharmacy as a clerk. I'm also doing minor translating work
          (from Korean to English) on the side. I have recently completed a
          Coding Bootcamp provided by UCI and am preparing to further develop
          myself in the software engineering field.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I am very curious about many different subjects, and enjoy learning
          new things. As such, I'm eager to take on new challenges and see what
          I can learn from them.
